It uses the following SDKs by Dynamsoft:

* Dynamic Web TWAIN: acquire images from document scanners.
* Dynamsoft Document Normalizer: crop ID cards in scanned document images.
* Dynamsoft Barcode Reader: read PDF417 on driver's licenses.
* Dynamsoft Label Recognizer: recognize MRZ on ID cards.
* Dynamsoft Code Parser: parse MRZ and barcodes to get meaningful data

Note: The latter four products (aggregation name: Dynamsoft Capture Vision) can use the same trial license while Dynamic Web TWAIN uses a separate license.
